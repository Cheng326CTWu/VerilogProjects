# VerilogProjects

This repo contains various medium-size projects (i.e. FIFO Memory) coded in verilog. This is used to further solidify understanding gained from self-studying the various combinational and sequential logic blocks located in the *VerilogPractice* repo. All links and tools listed below are used solely for the purpose of learning verilog and digital logic concepts.

**NOTE:** projects in this repo are done solely without any hardware (i.e. a FPGA dev board). Projects in this repo will eventually be verified on some hardware platform which will be indicated later on in the section below.

## Software Requirement

Any of the below can be used:

* ModelSim + Mentor Graphics Precision RTL **(Optional)**
* Icarus Verilog + GTKWave - **(Should include synthesis option but not tested!)**
* Vivado/ISE
* Quartus Prime

Projects in this repo are compiled using ModelSim. However, efforts will be made to ensure all projects are compilable across all software tools and projects will be synthesizable.

## Hardware Requirement (Optional)

The board(s) listed below are potential requirement which can likely be used for hardware verification later on. It is simply a sort of wish list or future planning which will be executed at an undetermined time in the future.

* DE-2 Development Board
* DE10-Nano Development Board

## Project Verification

This section will outlines a checklist for what has been verified for the projects in this repo.

| Verification(s)                   | Current Status    |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Compliable                        | In Progress       |
| Simulation Correctness            | In Progress       |
| Synthesizable                     | In Progress       |
| Hardware Platform Verification    | TBD               |
